*3.RF, Ray Flags*

Flags controlling the properties of an *OpTraceRayKHR* instruction
or for comparing against the *IncomingRayFlagsKHR* builtin.
See the Ray Tracing chapter of the Vulkan API specification for
more details.

Despite being a mask and allowing multiple bits to be combined,
it is invalid for more than one of these four bits to be set:
*OpaqueKHR*, *NoOpaqueKHR*, *CullOpaqueKHR*, *CullNoOpaqueKHR*.
Additionally, only one of *CullBackFacingTrianglesKHR* and
*CullFrontFacingTrianglesKHR* may be set.

Validation Rules
----------------

An OpExtension must be added to the SPIR-V for validation layers to check
legal use of this extension:

----
OpExtension "SPV_KHR_ray_query"
----

Interactions with SPV_KHR_ray_tracing
-------------------------------------

*OpTypeAccelerationStructureKHR*, *RayTraversalPrimitiveCullingProvisionalKHR*, and the
`Ray Flags` are added by both this extension and `SPV_KHR_ray_tracing`; they
are intended to have identical definitions, and can be enabled by either
extension's capability, for use with the instructions under that same
capability.

Issues
------

None yet!
