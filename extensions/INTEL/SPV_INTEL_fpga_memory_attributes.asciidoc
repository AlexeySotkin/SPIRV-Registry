== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SPIR-V Specification,
Version 1.3 Revision 6.

This extension requires SPIR-V 1.0.

== Overview

This extension adds decorations that influence compiler generation of memory structures on an FPGA target.

== Extension Name
To use this extension within a SPIR-V module, the following *OpExtension* must be present in the module:

----
OpExtension "SPV_INTEL_fpga_memory_attributes"
----
 
== New capabilities
This extension introduces a new capability:

----
FPGAMemoryAttributesINTEL
----

== New Decorations

Decorations added under the *FPGAMemoryAttributes* capability:

----
RegisterINTEL
MemoryINTEL
NumbanksINTEL
BankwidthINTEL
----

== Modifications to the SPIR-V Specification, Version 1.3

=== Decoration

Modify Section 3.20, Decoration, adding these rows to the Decoration table:

--
[options="header"]
|====
2+^| Decoration	^| Enabling Capabilities ^| Extra Operands
| 5825 | *RegisterINTEL* +
Apply to a variable or a structure-type member. Request, to the extent possible, that the variable or structure member should be implemented in logic and carried through the datapath. 
| *FPGAMemoryAttributesINTEL* |
| 5826 | *MemoryINTEL* +
Apply to a variable or a structure-type member. Request, to the extent possible, that the variable or structure member should be implemented in memory of the specified type. 
| *FPGAMemoryAttributesINTEL* | Literal String +
_Memory Type_
| 5827 | *NumBanksINTEL*  +
Apply to a variable or a structure-type member. Request, to the extent possible, that the variable or structure member should be implemented in a memory with the specified number of banks.
| *FPGAMemoryAttributesINTEL* | Literal Number +
_Banks_
| 5828 | *BankwidthINTEL* +
Apply to a variable or a structure-type member. Request, to the extent possible, that the variable or structure member should be implemented in a memory whose banks have the specified width in bytes.
| *FPGAMemoryAttributesINTEL* | Literal Number +
_Bank Width_
